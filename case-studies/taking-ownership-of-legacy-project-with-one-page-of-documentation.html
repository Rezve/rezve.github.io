        <h1>Taking Ownership of a Legacy Project with Just One Page of Documentation</h1>
        <p class="disclaimer-note">
            <strong>Note:</strong> This case study is based on my personal experience, written by me and refined with AI tools for clarity and polish.
        </p>
        <p>Imagine inheriting a critical food delivery system that serves thousands of customers daily—yet, the only
            documentation you receive is a single page with a few lines about its features. That was the challenge I
            faced when I took over HungryNaki, an online platform where users order food from over 750 restaurants
            across Dhaka, Chittagong, and Sylhet.</p>
        <p>The platform operates with 1,500+ riders and 25 hubs, ensuring most orders are delivered within an hour.
            Customers rely on its website and mobile apps to search for restaurants, place orders, and get their food
            delivered seamlessly. However, the system struggled to handle peak-hour traffic, leading to frequent
            failures, frustrated customers, and business disruptions.</p>

        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>I was assigned as the lead for this project, a live system with ongoing client dissatisfaction. The system
            struggled to handle peak-hour traffic, particularly in the evenings when most customers placed orders or
            when the marketing team launched new discount promotions.</p>
        <p>This was not a small system—it included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 iOS app</li>
            <li>3 Android apps</li>
            <li>3 web platforms</li>
            <li>1 Node.js backend supporting the entire load</li>
            <li>100+ MongoDB collections</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I was leading a team of four junior developers, most of whom were new to the project. The available
            documentation consisted of just one page, containing only a 4–5 line overview of its features.</p>

        <h2>My Approach</h2>
        <p>My first goal was to understand the full lifecycle of a single request—from the client app or web platform to
            the server and all the components it passed through.</p>
        <p>Once I gained an understanding of how the system functioned and the roles of different components, I focused
            on identifying system bottlenecks using metrics. However, I quickly discovered that we had minimal
            monitoring in place, forcing me to rely on system usage patterns instead.</p>
        <p>I also found that the system was a monolith, running on a single server with a high load on MongoDB. To
            improve scalability, I planned to transition it into a modular monolith, ensuring that we wouldn’t be
            limited to a single instance.</p>

        <h2>Execution</h2>
        <h3>Short-Term Fixes (Immediate Stability & Performance Improvement)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fixed DNS Issue:</strong> Discovered that our Cloudflare subscription had expired, causing
                intermittent failures. Renewed the subscription to restore stability.</li>
            <li><strong>Increased System Capacity:</strong> Adjusted server resources to temporarily handle peak traffic
                more efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Database Indexing:</strong> Analyzed MongoDB queries and added missing indexes to speed up
                frequent read operations, reducing query execution time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Long-Term Fixes (Scalability & Architectural Improvements)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Modular Monolith Refactoring:</strong> Planned a transition from a monolithic system to a
                modular monolith, allowing independent scaling of critical services without full system dependency.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Query Optimization & Indexing:</strong> Introduced compound indexes and fine-tuned
                existing ones based on query patterns to improve database efficiency further.</li>
            <li><strong>Load Balancing & Horizontal Scaling:</strong> Deployed additional instances behind a load
                balancer to distribute traffic evenly.</li>
            <li><strong>Asynchronous Processing:</strong> Moved non-critical operations (e.g., notifications, analytics
                updates) to background jobs using a queue system to reduce request-response time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The immediate system failures during peak hours were mitigated, allowing the business to continue operations.
        </p>
        <p>However, performance was still slow at peak times, requiring further optimization efforts.</p>

        <h2>Learnings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The importance of logging and monitoring in a live system.</li>
            <li>Prioritizing business-critical issues first—focusing on the most impactful problems rather than trying
                to fix everything at once.</li>
            <li>Thorough documentation is essential—future developers can understand the code, but high-level overviews,
                implementation details, and key considerations are often missing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Starting work on a new system—especially one with minimal documentation—can be overwhelming. The best
            approach is to begin with the smallest unit, gradually expand understanding, and prioritize the most
            critical issues first.</p>

        <h2>Key Technologies & Tools</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>MongoDB</li>
            <li>Redis</li>
            <li>Elasticsearch</li>
            <li>GraphQL</li>
            <li>Java</li>
        </ul>
